1. What has been your experience learning bash?
I’ve enjoyed learning bash. I like Linux a lot and use it in my personal life so I already knew some bash but I liked improving my skills with it and learning new commands. 
2. What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?
I liked having our 3 hour class block be an open lab. I felt like that gave me a good time to go and work on the lab and get any help if I needed it. The only struggle I experienced was sometimes I felt like the lab instructions were unclear and I wasn’t entirely sure what was being asked for.
3. Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?
I spent more time on the labs at the beginning of the semester. I think I spent about 5-6 hours on each lab. Now, I’ve gotten more familiar with what I need to do and I’d say I can usually finish them in 4-5 hours.
4. Are you able to see how the programs used in this class or learning bash would be helpful for your career?
Yes, I think automation is incredibly useful and something that can be used to some degree in any career.
